# saas-codetests
Fixed markdown in readme file
## Overview
There are three tasks located in separate files. They are implemented as test cases which you'll have to ensure pass. Feel free to update/refactor defined structures and the rest of the code. Some tasks have a broad definition intentionally so you could add more detail while working on a task. There may be bugs in the tests, just point them out in the comments and fix them. There isn't a single correct solution; the tasks are designed in a way to show us how you solve problems and your way of thinking rather than testing particular coding patterns.

Please ensure that your solution is runable and if any special instructions are needed to run your solution then please include them in your solution. 

You are welcome to choose the language in which you solve each task. Currently we provide tests for Golang as well as C#, however if you are uncomfortable with either of those languages, we are more than happy to accept and assess tests that have been implemented in TypeScript or JavaScript.

## deepest-letter
Implement a function which returns the letter (a-z, lowercase) that is found in the deepest parentheses-scope or returns '?' if the input string is malformed.

## api
Implement api function which updates user information.

## battleship
Implement shoot function which takes a shot coordinate as an input and returns whether an enemy's ship is hit and whether it's sunk.
